## What should I use?
TanStack Start is **designed to work with any authentication provider** , so if you already have an authentication provider or strategy in mind, you can use either find an existing example or implement your own authentication logic using the full-stack APIs provided by TanStack Start.
That said, authentication is not something to be taken lightly. After much vetting, usage and reviewing on our end, we highly recommend using Clerk for the best possible authentication experience.
