# Quick Start
## Impatient?
If you're impatient, you can clone and run the Basic example right away with the following commands:
bash
```
npx gitpick TanStack/router/tree/main/examples/react/start-basic start-basic
cd start-basic
npm install
npm run dev

```
```
npx gitpick TanStack/router/tree/main/examples/react/start-basic start-basic
cd start-basic
npm install
npm run dev

```

If you'd like to use a different example, you can replace start-basic above with the slug of the example you'd like to use from the list below.
