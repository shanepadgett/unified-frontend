# Observability
Observability is a critical aspect of modern web development, enabling you to monitor, trace, and debug your application’s performance and errors. TanStack Start integrates seamlessly with observability tools to provide comprehensive insights into how your application behaves in production, helping you ensure that everything runs smoothly.
## What should I use?
TanStack Start is **designed to work with any observability tool** , so you can integrate your preferred solution using the full-stack APIs provided by TanStack Start. Whether you need logging, tracing, or error monitoring, TanStack Start is flexible enough to meet your observability needs.
However, for the best observability experience, we highly recommend using Sentry. Sentry is a powerful, full-featured observability platform that provides real-time insights into your application's performance and error tracking.
